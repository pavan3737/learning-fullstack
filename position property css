        <p>in css using position property we can change the position of 
    words
    *position is a property in css in these it is initally static
    *static means initially top,bottom,left,right and z-index can't be written.
    *position relative is opposite to static we can apply properties
    *z-index is that in which it helps to on box to lay over another box
    *position relative helps work related with parents are condition
    *position absolute says it is absolute and we can move it out of 
    normal flow that is like top or out of border
    *postion fixed is like makes it as fixed and fixes
    and we scroll the page it fixes there and it does'nt move
    *postion sticky makes it like similar to fixed but when we scroll every other
    matter or boxes goes beneath it
    *there were few exceptions they are *filter,*prespective properties,*transform makes nthink it is as positioned property
