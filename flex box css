    <p>
        *prevously the usage positioning and float,clear become some hard to use 
        that why flex box is introduced in css3
        *intially inorder to use flex box we need to give display flex so that 
        we can flex box porperties and default properties are applied on it
        and by dafault the items becomes left to right.
        *by using justify-content:center then content becomes center horixontally
        and by using align-items:center the content becomes center vertically
        *there are some many properties inside it(justify and align) they 
         flexend,flet start,space between etc.
         *the items are not always left to right it depends upon flex direction
         by default it is from left to right.
         *flex direction: it is that where the items are being laid by default the items are laid left to right
          we can change it top bottom ,column,column reverse
        *the flex direction is called main axis and cross axis is perpendicular to it
        and  the distance is called main size and cross size
        *  flex wrap helps to make content come to new line and there is also wrap reverse
        *there is no justify iems in flex box
        * by using gap property we can define space between items.in gap we have row,column gap types
           (gap 10px 40px)-says gap between row and column
        *order helps to set position of elemnts depending upon its values.default order is zero
        *flex sets the width of the items by default it is 0 if we set flex grow equal to 2 the that item will
        take 2 items space compared to other items                                                                                                                                                                                justify content center depends upon main axis
        *flex shrink is the ability of the item to shirnk
        *align self helps to set alignment of a particular element
